# Production-Grade AI & Automation Systems  
### n8n · LLMs · Business-Critical Workflows

This repository contains a curated collection of **end-to-end, production-ready AI automation systems** built using **n8n**, LLMs, and real-world SaaS integrations.

These workflows are not experiments or showcase demos.  
They represent **systems designed, shipped, and iterated under real client constraints**, where reliability, clarity, and adaptability matter as much as technical depth.

Each workflow addresses a concrete operational or revenue-facing problem and is designed to function as part of a broader business ecosystem.

---

## Repository Context

This repository reflects work built across **multiple client environments, industries, and stages of operational maturity** - from early-stage teams to structured, process-heavy organizations.

The systems here follow a **freelancer ownership model**:
designing, implementing, evolving, and maintaining automation in environments that are often incomplete, fast-moving, and constraint-driven.

Rather than focusing on a single niche, the workflows demonstrate **breadth with depth**:
the ability to move fluidly across sales, operations, finance, support, marketing, and internal tooling while maintaining consistent engineering discipline.

The emphasis throughout is on **practical automation** - systems that continue to work after handoff, scale with usage, and remain understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Engineering Approach & Scope

All workflows in this repository are built with a **production-first mindset**.

Core principles:
- End-to-end ownership from trigger to outcome
- Modular design for reuse and extension
- Explicit handling of failure paths and edge cases
- LLMs used as **reasoning and decision components**, not novelty layers
- Clear separation between orchestration, intelligence, and execution

These systems prioritize **operational leverage**:
reducing manual effort, improving signal quality, and enabling teams to act faster without adding hidden complexity.

The approach reflects experience working as a **senior technical freelancer**, where versatility, judgment, and long-term maintainability are critical.

## Core Stack

- **n8n** – workflow orchestration and control plane  
- **LLMs** – structured prompting, reasoning, classification, summarization  
- **APIs & SaaS integrations** – CRM, messaging, documents, finance, analytics  
- **Event, webhook, and schedule-driven architectures**  
- **Logging, validation, and fallback logic**
